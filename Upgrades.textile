## Upgrade: From 0.5 to 0.6

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.6, projects follow an OTP layout, and the admin interface is a standalone OTP application.

To upgrade, you will need to do the following in your project:

bc. mkdir src
mkdir priv
mv controller/ init/ lib/ mail/ model/ test/ view/ src/
mv lang/ static/ priv/
PROJECT=my_application mv boss.routes priv/$PROJECT.routes

In addition, you will need to prefix your controller modules with the application name. E.g.
@mv blog_controller.erl my_application_blog_controller.erl@

This avoids module naming conflicts when multiple applications are installed on the same server (which was not possible prior to 0.6).

h2. Upgrade the framework: Chicago Boss 0.5 and later

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.5, your project is kept separate from the Chicago Boss source code. The project files "start.sh" and "start-dev.sh" contain references to the CB ebin/ directory. After downloading a new version of CB, simply type "make" to build it, and then update your "start.sh" and "start-dev.sh" files according to point to the new CB version, if it's in a new directory.

However, the /admin interface is considered part of your project (this will probably change in the future). If you want to take advantage of new features in the /admin interface, you need to replace your project's "admin" directory with the "skel/admin" directory from the CB source.

h2. Upgrade the framework: Chicago Boss 0.4 to 0.5

The easiest way to upgrade to 0.5 is to create a new project and copy your project code over. In the ChicagoBoss-0.5.x directory, type

bc. make
make app PROJECT=mynewproject
cd ../mynewproject

The new project structure should look like this:

bc. emiller blackstone ~/src/mynewproject $ ls -l
total 208
-rw-r--r--  Makefile
drwxr-xr-x  admin
-rw-r--r--  boss.config
drwxr-xr-x  controller
drwxr-xr-x  ebin
drwxr-xr-x  lang
drwxr-xr-x  lib
drwxr-xr-x  log
drwxr-xr-x  mail
drwxr-xr-x  model
-rwxr-xr-x  start-dev.sh
-rw-r--r--  start-server.bat
-rwxr-xr-x  start.sh
drwxr-xr-x  static
drwxr-xr-x  test
drwxr-xr-x  view

You are now ready to copy over your old project files. Because the only project files that matter begin with lower-case letters, this is as simple as:

bc. cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/[a-z]* /path/to/new/mynewproject

You should now be ready to go. Type "./start-dev.sh" in the new project directory and test out your server!

## Hot-upgrades in production
Chicago Boss 0.5 features hot-upgrades of framework and project code in production. To upgrade your project code:

# Type "make" in your project directory to compile your project
# Copy the ebin/*.beam files over to the project ebin/ directory of your production server
# Visit /admin/upgrade on the production server
# Click the button that says "Upgrade BEAM Code"

That's it, you're done. There should be no downtime or lost requests of any kind.
