An admin interface for ChicagoBoss is available as a separate application.

To install it please follow these steps:

<code> $ git clone https://github.com/evanmiller/chicagoboss_admin.git cb_admin </code>

 _The directory where you checkout the code needs to be in the same directory that contains the Chicago Boss directory and should be called @cb_admin@._

<pre>
<code>$ cd cb_admin
$ make
</code></pre> 

Then add an entry for the cb_admin application in your project configuration file:

<pre><code>
    [{boss, [
        {applications, [cb_admin, ...]},
        ...
    ]},
    {cb_admin, [
        {path, "/path/to/cb_admin"},
        {allow_ip_blocks, ["127.0.0.1"]},
        {base_url, "/admin"}
    ]}].

</code></pre>
You should now be able to point your browser at /admin.
