h1. Admin Interface

An admin interface for ChicagoBoss is available as a separate application.

To install it please follow these steps:

 $ git clone https://github.com/evanmiller/chicagoboss_admin.git cb_admin

(!) The directory where you checkout the code needs to be called @cb_admin@ and nothing else.

 $ cd cb_admin
 $ make

Then add an entry for the cb_admin application in your project configuration file:


    [{boss, [
        {applications, [cb_admin, ...]},
        ...
    ]},
    {cb_admin, [
        {allow_ip_blocks, ["127.0.0.1"]},
        {base_url, "/admin"}
    ]}].

You should now be able to point your browser at /admin.
